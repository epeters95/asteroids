Asteroids
=========

My version of the classic arcade game Asteroids, written in Javascript. The visuals are done using HTML Canvas.

The objective is to destroy every asteroid on the screen as quickly as possible.  Use the WASD keys to rotate/power your ship, and the spacebar to shoot.

Features:
- Session best score
- Particle effects (see particle.js)
- Smooth collision physics between asteroids (see game.js:199)
- Use of [keymaster.js](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) for better keyboard input
